# Mini Game Project

## Description
This mini game project is built using Ren'Py, a visual novel engine. The game features a narrative-driven experience with interactive elements, allowing players to engage with the story and characters.

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

```
mini-game-project
├── game
│   ├── script.rpy        # Main script containing the narrative and game logic
│   ├── images            # Directory for image assets
│   │   └── placeholder.txt
│   ├── audio             # Directory for audio assets
│   │   └── placeholder.txt
│   └── gui               # Directory for GUI assets
│       └── placeholder.txt
├── options.rpy           # Configuration options for the game
├── screens.rpy           # Custom screens for the game
├── gui.rpy               # GUI definitions and styles
└── README.md             # Project documentation
```
